		<p style="text-indent: 5%; color:#74776D; font-size:100%"> Growth is a crucial part of being. An individual life develops much in the same way a culture evolves and an era ends. 
	They all grow into something else, beyond what they were before. Whether this growth is beneficial or harmful is to be seen, 
	as progress is not linear. Rather, growth is something that is continuous and ever striving forward. </p>
		<p style="text-indent: 5%; color:#74776D; font-size:100%"> Part of being an artist is the process of creating, but also the process of growing. 
	A piece can develop from a single messy line on the back of a worksheet. Likewise, 
	an artist develops with their work. What changes can occur in a week? A month? A year? 
	The development of an artist as their own person is deeply intertwined in the creation of their art. 
	Whether my art takes a personal note or not, it is an extension of myself by being my own creation. It grows with me.
